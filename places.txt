at the reservoir
in a phonebooth
at the gas station
at the orange soda stand
at the grocery store
at the zoo
at the bank
on the corner
backstage
on Christmas
by the water tower
in Tokyo
in Peru
in a chatroom
after English class
at the airport
at the park
at 5th and Main
at the Oscars
in Church
at the studio
at the White House
at www.chucknorrisfacts.com
in France
in the dumpster
by the men's room
where we did the thing with the guy with the hair
in a year
with a better accent
across traffic lanes
on the phone
a Hoobastank concert
below the bridge
on Saturn
at the flag pole
in five minutes
after you sell them
by checkout #5
at ten o'clock
by the pool
when your plane lands in Denver
with a towel on
in Karate class
before you do anything else
with a pack of cigarettes
on Tuesday
at the zoo
by the water fountain
invisibly
with or without your little friend
at the bank
on AIM
in the fourth grade, retard
at Ruby Tuesday
at the Star Trek convention
before the noon deadline
after the sneak preview
in the lab
after you shower
in my room
at the Emerald city
